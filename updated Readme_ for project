## Business Problem
We are here to provide our findings to use as a guide to be included in an AARP feature story for retirees to make sound, real estate investments. 



A little background some of you may know, Barbara- but if you don’t, she is a part-time writer for AARP magazine and it was her idea for this feature story. Barbara is a widow, mother of three, breast cancer survivor. Her medical bills and her late husband’s passing put pressure on her finances. Like many retired Americans, she worries about what she will leave for her children/grand children so she decided to publish a guide for the retired to make conscious decisions about their future


So we are here to provide our findings to use as a guide for retirees to make sound real estate investments. For applicability reasons(bc not everyone wants to relocate) we decided to split research into 3 regions. East Coast, South/Mid west and west coast. 
In our analyses of these regions, 3 states proved to be the most profitable. we found On the east coast -Homestead in Florida had a high ROI of 66%, In South/midwest Texas we found Austin to be the most profitable at 98% and West coast we have  Richmond California at 101% 

To conclude our recommendations, we found Homestread, Florida with ROI 66%, Austin Texas at 98% and Richmond CA at 101% are recommendable investments

For the future we’d like to take into consideration how the Pandemic has affected the volatility of the market including interest rates and inflation. Also the Quality City amenities as well as Costs of living and state tax rates
